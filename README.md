# Hangman

Hangman is a classic wordgame, usually played by two or more players. The game involves guessing letters in a word whose letters are initially completely hidden, but which are shown as clues when the player successfully guesses them.
The secret word is displayed as horizontal bars as the number of letters in the word, and the player have a number of guesses to find the hidden word. If the user guesses a letter that is not in the word, a line is drawn to a figure which, when completed, will represent a hanged lineman, and then the game is over. 
This Hangman game is written in Python and the user plays in a terminal based window.
